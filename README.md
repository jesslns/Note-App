# Note App

This is a frontend, single page web app within which users can create notes. The requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/00_challenge_track.md).<br>
See user stories and mockups [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/notes_app_user_stories.md).

## Approach

- TDD (primarily unit tests) to implement single note page.
- Spike to add 'create note' functionality.
- Use the constructor and prototype pattern.
- JavaScript module pattern.

## Instructions

#### Install node and http-server
Open your terminal and at your file root, enter the following lines:
```
$ brew install node

$ npm init
$ npm install http-server --save
```
To run the server from command land, type in your terminal:
```
$ node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
```
and go to ` http://localhost:8080/`.

#### Learning Goal
- Writing tests without a testing library, i.e. develop my own test framework. [Pill is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/writing_tests_without_a_testing_library.md).
- Learn JavaScript module pattern.
- Learn further frontend with JavaScript.
