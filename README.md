## Note App

This is a frontend, single page web app.The requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/00_challenge_track.md).
See user stories and mockups [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/notes_app_user_stories.md.)

### Approach

- TDD (primarily unit tests) to implement single note page.
- Spike to add 'create note' functionality.
- Use the constructor and prototype pattern.
- JavaScript module pattern.


### Goal
- Writing tests without a testing library, i.e. develop my own test framework. [Pill is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/writing_tests_without_a_testing_library.md).
- Learn JavaScript module pattern.
- Learn further frontend with JavaSCript.
